# Firmware

- ## Bootloader

Before you use this RRF firmware, you need to follow the README [here](https://github.com/FYSETC/FYSETC-SPIDER/tree/main/bootloader) to upload the bootloader `Bootloader_FYSETC_SPIDER.hex` first. 

- ## Firmware

This firmware is base on [gloomyandy/RRFBuild at v3.3-dev (github.com)](https://github.com/gloomyandy/RRFBuild/tree/v3.3-dev). The original firmware size is larger than 512k which exceed STM32F446 chip flash room. So i remove/disable some features. You can check what have been changed below. And there is `Patches` folder showing all the changes.

- ## Pre-builds

This folder contains a firmware named `firmware.bin` , you can start RRF by flashing this firmware to have a try.

- # config

There is `config` folder beside this README file, it is just an example config to run RRF. Copy all contents in the `config` folder to your sdcard root directory. You need to know this is just example for you to try RRF, it not for VORON or any machines. And if you make the right config for VORON, please make a PR for me, i will update it ASAP, thanks in advance. 

# Hardware

If you want to build a machine with this RRF firmware, then you have three ways to communicate with/control your machine.

- USB serial

After you flash bootloader and firmware, and insert the sdcard with example config(i really recommend you to make the config yourself), you should get information from USB serial now(Of course, you need a USB cable to connect Spider to your PC). So you can control the motherboard using RRF [gcode](https://duet3d.dozuki.com/Wiki/Gcode) now.

- Paneldue

Control the machine with USB serial will be a hard job, so you may need a screen. And i remove other lcd support in this firmware, so i recommend you to use Paneldue, you can get it from our store [here](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000156345741.html). You can connect it to Spider using the wiring below.![](images/paneldue.jpg)
